# Predicting-the-Estimated-Stock-Percentage

In this project, I employed the Random Forest Regressor algorithm in Python to predict the estimated percentage change in stock prices. The model achieved an impressive mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24, demonstrating its accuracy in forecasting stock movements.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises historical stock data from cognizant, along with relevant market and company-specific features. It was collected from reliable financial sources, and I ensured that the data used in the project is for demonstration purposes only. To evaluate the model's accuracy, I calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted and actual stock percentage values. The achieved MAE of 0.24 indicates the model's reliability in predicting stock movements.

### Tools Used
- Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modelling.
- scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library used for building the Random Forest Regressor model.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: To visualize the data and model performance.

## How to Run the Notebooks Locally
To run the Jupyter notebooks and explore the project locally, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Launch a Jupyter notebook server or use VScode with Jupyter integration.
4. Open the notebook of interest and execute the cells step by step.

## Conclusion
Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet crucial task in the financial world. The success of this project in achieving a low mean absolute error demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms, particularly the Random Forest Regressor, in forecasting stock movements. By continuously improving and fine-tuning models, we can gain valuable insights into the financial markets and make informed investment decisions.

### FAQs

1. **What is the significance of using Random Forest Regressor for stock price prediction?**
   The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees. Its ability to handle complex relationships and reduce overfitting makes it suitable for predicting stock prices, which involve intricate market dynamics.

2. **Can I use the provided datasets for my own analysis?**
   Yes, although it is recommended to use more detailed financial data from authorized sources for any practical investment or analysis.

3. **Are the Jupyter notebooks accessible in R markdown format as well?**
  I'm afraid No, this repository only contain Jupyter Notebook markdown files. 

4. **How can I contribute to this repository?**
   Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new projects, improvements, or bug fixes, submit a pull request or get in touch via GitHub.

5. **Are the projects on your website updated regularly?**
   Yes, I strive to keep my portfolio up-to-date with the latest projects and improvements. Visit my repositories to explore my recent data science journey.
